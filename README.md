# dual-booting

I have created a new repository for The Odin Project: dual boot linux ubuntu on windows laptop (as a substitute for the prescribed recipes exercise)

 My intention is to show the steps I followed and what I learned in the process: hopefully it will be of value to some others going through the same exercise (more value than my recipes will be at least and hopefully achieves the same objectives but the presentation matters to me a little more in this case).

I hope to consolidate my learning about github repositories, html, hypertext references and images anchors, headings and paragraph, ordered and unordered lists and linking to additonal pages.

I am following all the instructions but the pages will be different steps for setting up dual boot instead of recipes.

As an additonal layer to improve my knowledge I am doing all of the work on this repository using gh (github cli) form terminal command line in VSCode so all files are created, edited and previewed in VSCode and commands are written in Terminal.

*I am getting some help from perplexity AI but I am being conscious about what kind of help I am using AI LLM for because I want to learn. So,*

For anything specified in the Odin Project Foundations course on the website - whether required reading or instructions - I am following every step.  

*Only for extra aspects outside Odin curriculum (troubleshooting ubuntu dual boot setup, figuring out what applications i can safely uninstall from ubuntu to save ssd space, and how to use gh from command line - and simply understand the differences between git and gh) I am using perplexity AI because I find it efficient to learn quickly.  Incidentally I am typing in suggested steps rather than simply cutting and pasting from the answers it gives so I am hopefully absorbing lessons rather than merely taking for granted its answers and following its suggestions. More on that later because AI has helped me have confidence I can pursue some of my objectives without which I would have had to simply have more humble objectives or a (much) longer timeframe.*
