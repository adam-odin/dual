    <h2>Logs</h2>
    <p>There are fantastic logs automatically kept and made readily accessible</p>

    <p>!Warning! Do not take everything you are "told" by an AI chatbot at face value. I have learned the hard way how lightly AI chatbots can make recommendations... little distinction made between a one line command that will require a full reinstallation of your entire ubuntu boot or a simple one line command listing the contents of the directory you happen to in, benignly making no changes whatsoever</p>
