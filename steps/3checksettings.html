    <h1>Check UEFI Settings</h1>
    <p>The UEFI settings control how your machine starts up: I am making another ordered list here because it is important to get each of these steps right! </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Change your UEFI setting from "RAID On" to "AHCI"</li>
        <li>Change your restart to Safe Mode</li>
        <li>Consider changing your Secure Boot to "Disabled"</li>
        <li>You might need to change your Start Override values to zero however I wouldn't bother with this is you don't need to</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You will get plenty of severe looking warnings along the way so we'll walk through each step in a little more detail so you have confidence to forge ahead despite the warnings - and hopefully your confidence is justified, or at least we can find an easy fix if it goes wrong.</p>
