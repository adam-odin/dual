    <h1>What to do when you see the dreaded blue screen of death</h1>
    <p>ok, I haven't actually had the experience of seeing a blue screen of death since starting to dual boot windows and linux. However I cam pretty close with this error message on screen:<br>
    <a img="../img/IMG8465.JPG">The equivalent of the dreaded blue screen of death</a><br>
    To put it mildly, this is not what you want to see when you boot up your machine on a Sunday morning when you have just been reflecting on how well everything seems to be going since you started dual booting with linux and windows, how comforting it is to know you have the control to choose between each at your convenience or expedience, and when you actually surprise yourself by how excited you are to boot linux up and get back to The Odin Project curriculum.<br>
    However what you need not do is panic. As explained by Perplexity AI, "quote". In short this problem has been experienced by many, is already known and understood to be causing many people issues, already has been fixed temporarily by disabling Secure Boot which is what we;re goign to do. and we are goign to plan ahead until shim updates are completed and we can install new version of ubuntu that doesn't conflict with the Secure Boot any longer and we can Enable that again for optimal security.</p>
