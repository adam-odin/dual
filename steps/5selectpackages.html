    <h1>What ubuntu packages come as standard?</h1>

    <h2>APT</h2>
    <h2>snap</h2>

    <h2>Optional: flatpak</h2>
    <h2>Optional: dpkg</h2>

    <h2>debian .dev and other linux file extensions</h2>
    <h3>Useful terminal commands</h3>
    <p>and <a href="../references/usefulcommands.html">Useful terminal Commands</a></p>

    <h1>Managing storage between SSD and HDD</h1>
    <h2>/root</h2>
    <h2>/usr</h2>
    <h2>etc</h2>
    <h2>/home</h2>

    <h1>Remove unwanted apps</h1>
    <p>Distinguish between those that are needed for other applications to function and those completely independent of others. If in doubt, don't do it the way I did it. I was willing to learn, for my sake and now hopefully the sake of others too.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thunderbird</li>
        <li>GNOME</li>
        <li>evolution</li>
        <li>games: solitaire, mahjong, mines</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Browsers</h1>
    <p>There are many options and this will undoubtedly reflect my preferences for uncluttered experience, privacy and avoiding unnecessary tracking. I think it is an aesthetic preference.  If it doesn't serve me, why give it over to others? Feel free to ignore this bit</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Firefox: comes as standard with Linux. Mozilla open-source</li>
        <li>Chrome: recommended by The Odin Project</li>
        <li>Ghostery: my preference</li>
        <li>Opera: reportedly free VPN within the browser. I tried it then removed it. really liked the side bars on the browser though</li>
        <li>Edge: Microsoft's default browser. Mercifully the adverts, left-triggering clickbait "news" articles and unnecessary tracking are scarce in a linux environment - it is like having a fresh breeze gently and warmly washing through the house working with linux after getting used to Microsoft edge.</li>
    </ul>
