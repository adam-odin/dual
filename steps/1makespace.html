    <h1>Use Disk Manager to partition space on your laptop for your Ubuntu</h1>
    <p>The first thing you need to do is make sure you have space for installing ubuntu and managing everything side by side with windows.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UEFI start up boot</li>
        <li>C: Your pc or Solid State Disk</li>
        <li>Recovery for Windows</li>
        <li>D: Your Hard Disk Drive</li>
        <li>Any virtual machines</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There are three main parts to think about: /root /home and RAM</p>
    <h2>SSD for /root</h2>

    <h2>HDD for /home</h2>
    <p>I really like the blog here: 
    and the proposed solution to use HDD for home and SSD for main install.
    Ideally if you have a lot of space in SSD then yuo can have it all in SSD and just use HDD for backups and large data files.</p>

    <h3>What to do if you don't have much contiguous space in your drives?</h3>
    <p>If you find you don't have much space in your SSD (C:)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>move documents to hard disk drive</li>
        <li>defragmenter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is recommended to have at least 30GB. <br>
    I had 19GB available and decided I would make it work or if it didn't work I would try my best and then deal with it and start again if it proved insufficient. As discussed later in <a href="steps/5selectpackages.html">what packages to keep in ubuntu</a> it is possible to be selective about the apps you use and many of them are unnecessary. I suppose i was confident trying and failing if that was how it woudl go. anyway, hopefully you can learn from my errors. I also haven't been using it long and may yet run into issues but I have been conscious about storage and currently utilising just over 50% with all the core packages installed and up and running, and with plenty of space still available in /home folder in the hard disk drive.</p>
