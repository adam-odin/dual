    <h1>How to dual boot Linux Ubuntu on a Windows laptop</h1>

    <h2>The Odin Project</h2>
    <p>I have just begun learning about web development, enrolled on The Odin Project and I am working through the exercises</p>

    <p>One of the first requirements is to install linux on one's machine. The Odin Project supports specifically ubuntu and recommends various methods for getting access to linux on a windows machine.</p>

    <p>I am pc. I am a bit fan of microsoft excel and always found it easiest to work in windows, in preference to mac or especially any google suite. That's just my preference.  However, from using linux for a few days I can say it is neat and clean and convenient and libre office is much more akin to excel, for exmaple, than google sheets is.  Anyway that is besides the point.</p>

    <p>I am committed to learning and completing The Odin Project so I decide to commit to dual boot on my machine. I backed up my files and prepared for some unpleasantness in pursuit of programming knowledge.</p>

    <p>The good news is the dual boot works very well. I am very grateful to have linux as an option and everything seems ot be workign well. However, I must note it has not been without its worrisome moments. There are a number of nasty warnings one has to have confidence to try to get through and there are times when it has looked liek things have gone wrong - which at least probabilisticaly I expected to be the case. Nonethless each of these issues has been commonly experienced and dealt with by others and the problem was also easily fixed in my case.</p>

    <p>This web page is my attempt to consolidate what I learnt and to share it with others working through this part  of The Odin Project Foundations course.</p>
